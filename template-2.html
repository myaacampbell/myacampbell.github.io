    <h3>alien game</h3>
    <p>
	the aim of this game is to collect guns and shoot at the enemies so that you can get to the next level, by collecting a certain amount.  there is muic on every level and sounds that you can hear when you pick up the gun and shoot at the enemy.  you can also press the ecape button where you can pause the game and go back and fourth from settings.  There are four levels of the game with different platforms and a faster paced song a you get higher into the levels.

	the challenge u have occured whilst playing this is changing the games levels and making usre everything worked inside of them.
